## Introduction
In the modern age, ensuring efficient mobility solutions is crucial for a city's transformation into a "Smart" city. While home delivery has been widely adopted by various industries to enhance their services, it often relies on human labor and vehicles, leading to increased fuel consumption. This project tackles this challenge by proposing the development of autonomous delivery robot specifically designed for our "Smart city" environment. These robots will revolutionize the delivery process by autonomously collecting medicine packets from pharmacies and distributing them across the city. Equipped with advanced navigation capabilities, the robots will seamlessly navigate the city, retrieve the required packets from designated shops, and transport them to the correct locations based on customer requests. Moreover, they will consider various arena parameters such as traffic signals and road closures due to ongoing construction, ensuring efficient and obstacle-free delivery operations.
